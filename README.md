Crystal Collectors 

1 - The Game
The player will have to guess the answer with numbers (hidden inside gems) to match the value displayed on screen. 

2 - How does it work?
There will be four crystals displayed on the page.
A random number will be shown at the start of the game.
Each crystal has a specific amount of points that will be added to the player's total score when clicked. 

The player wins if their total score matches the number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
